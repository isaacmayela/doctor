                <li class="items"><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</li>
                <li class="items"><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li class="items"><strong>1953</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li class="items"><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>

                <li class="items"><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li class="items"><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
